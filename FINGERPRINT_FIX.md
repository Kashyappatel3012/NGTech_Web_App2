# Browser Fingerprint Fix - MD5 Compatibility

## Issue
The HR Manager user with browser fingerprint "485fdd03538a8c43174d9c57819143b8" was unable to access the application.

## Root Cause
The browser fingerprint generation was changed from MD5 (32 hexadecimal characters) to SHA-256 (64 hexadecimal characters) for security reasons. However, the database still contains MD5 fingerprints, causing a mismatch:
- **Stored in Database**: MD5 format (32 chars) - "485fdd03538a8c43174d9c57819143b8"
- **Generated by Browser**: SHA-256 format (64 chars) - Different hash value

## Solution
Reverted browser fingerprint generation back to MD5 to maintain compatibility with existing database fingerprints.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **static/JS/login.js**
   - Changed from `CryptoJS.SHA256()` back to `CryptoJS.MD5()`
   - Added comment about backward compatibility

2. **static/JS/verify_otp.js**
   - Changed from `CryptoJS.SHA256()` back to `CryptoJS.MD5()`
   - Added comment about backward compatibility

3. **app.py**
   - Updated docstring to reflect MD5 usage
   - Simplified validation function (removed migration logic)

## Current Status
✅ Browser fingerprint generation now uses MD5 (32 characters)
✅ Matches existing database fingerprints
✅ HR Manager should now be able to access the application

## Future Migration Path
To migrate to SHA-256 in the future:
1. Generate SHA-256 fingerprints for all users in their browsers
2. Update database with new SHA-256 fingerprints
3. Change JavaScript back to SHA-256
4. Remove MD5 support

## Testing
1. Open the login page in the browser
2. Check that the browser fingerprint displayed is 32 characters (MD5 format)
3. Verify it matches the stored fingerprint "485fdd03538a8c43174d9c57819143b8" for HR Manager
4. Login should now work correctly
